# TrainScheduler

### How My TrainScheduler Webpage Works

* Accepts user input to add new train name, start time, frequency to schedule.
* Displays schedule in repeating table with new arrivals based on current time and frequency of trains stops.
* stores train information in Firebase for data presistance and retrieves information from database on load.
* Schedules refresh every minute to reflect updated arrival information.
