# TrainScheduler

### How My TrainScheduler Webpage Works

* It accepts user input to add new train name, start time, frequency to schedule.
* It displays schedule in repeating table with new arrivals based on current time and frequency of trains stops.
* It stores train information in Firebase for data presistance and retrieves information from database on load.
* The train schedules refresh every minute to reflect updated arrival information.
* User can delete train information from schedule and database with a click of a button.
