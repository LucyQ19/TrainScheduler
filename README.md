### About my App:

This is a Firebase-backed train scheduler.  It uses Firebase to host a globally available set of data that will be retrieved and manipulated using Moment.js to provide up-to-date information about the arrival times and minutes until arrival of various trains that user inputs. 

### How My trainScheduler App Works

* It accepts user input to add new train name, start time, frequency to schedule.
* It displays schedule in repeating table with new arrivals based on current time and frequency of trains stops.
* It stores train information in Firebase for data presistance and retrieves information from database on load.
* The train schedules refresh every minute to reflect updated arrival information.
* Th user can delete train information from schedule and database with a click of a button.

### Technologies Used for this App:

* Bootstrap,
* Moment.js,
* Firebase, and
* jQuery
